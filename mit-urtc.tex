\begin{abstract}
IoT Network Monitor is an intuitive and user-friendly interface for consumers to visualize vulnerabilities of IoT devices in their home. Running on a Raspberry Pi v3 which is configured as a router, the IoT Network Monitor analyzes the traffic of connected devices in three ways. First, it detects devices with default passwords exploited by previous attacks such as the Mirai Botnet, changes the passwords to a randomly generated 12 character string, and reports the new password to the user. Secondly, it conducts deep packet analysis on the data stream of each device and notifies the user of potentially sensitive personal information that is being transmitted in the clear. Lastly, it detects IoT Botnet DoS traffic originating from an IoT device connected to the network and instructs the user to disconnect the device if it has been hacked. This user-friendly IoT Network Monitor will enable homeowners to maintain the security of their home network and better understand what actions are appropriate when a certain security vulnerability is detected. A wide adoption of this tool will not only make consumers' homes more secure, but also get us a step closer to a more secure IoT network.
